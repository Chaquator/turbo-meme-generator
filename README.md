# Turbo Meme Generator

A tool I made that uses templates and simages (short for "surrogate images") to generate abstract sh*tposts.

Runs on Python 3.4(.2)

## Install
Check [releases](https://github.com/Chaquator/turbo-meme-generator/releases).

The database is available [here](https://github.com/Chaquator/turbo-meme-generator-database).

## Usage
I'm literally gonna let [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) write this for me because I don't want to waste the effort.
```
usage: turbomeme.py [-h] [-c file] [-sl dir] [-tl dir] [-uf dir] [-q int]
                    [-co count] [-tf file]
                    out

Churns memes at the speed of sound

positional arguments:
  out                   Output file (or directory if you're using count)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c file, --config file
                        Specify custom config. The default config is in the
                        same directory as the install.
  -sl dir, --simages-location dir
                        Location for simages
  -tl dir, --templates-location dir
                        Location for templates
  -uf dir, --unused-file dir
                        Location for unused files
  -q int, --quality int
                        Quality of image from 1 (worst) to 95 (best)
  -co count, --count count
                        Specify how many memes you intend to output
  -tf file, --template-file file
                        Override choosing random template and supply your own,
                        instead. Used for testing purposes
```

## Build
Run `setup.py` inside the directory to compile it into a single `.exe` file. 

Dependencies (that aren't included in a standard install of Python 3.4.2):
- [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) (only if you plan to build with `setup.py` obviously)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/) (fork of old PIL, updated for Python 3.4)
